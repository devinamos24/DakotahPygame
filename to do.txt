center map area
figur out how to get both the map and cards to fit on screen
make the cards one sprite sheet (possibly per item)
track a larger map maybe?
	possible metamap with numbers to track which room you are in and what sub map to pull from
make the cards come from a deck
	make the cards disaper after use
	have a redraw hand card always in hand
make inventory system
	tie cards to an item
