## Project
This project is a collaborate project between [devinamos24](https://github.com/devinamos24) and [DakotahPro](https://github.com/DakotahPro). This project is to help use and learn game architecture programming from [Bob Nysstrom's](https://github.com/munificent) "[*Game Programming Patterns*](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)".

This project's completion is tentative. This project will be considered complete once we believe we have a good grasp of game architecture concepts or when the game hits a natural stopping point, as to not add features for the sake of adding features.
